A black and white shading picture  
Those two pictures **must be same size of pixels, not over 1000 times 1000 pixels. The black and white shading picture must be RGB three-channel picture.** You should rename the color filling picture as **1.jpg** and the black and white shading picture as **2.jpg**, drag the pictures in the python folder and run the code. You can get a colored shading picture "3.jpg"
